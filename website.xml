<section><title>What is a PoD?</title>
<para>
<emphasis role="bold">PROOF on Demand (PoD)</emphasis> is a set of utilities, which allows starting a <ulink url="http://root.cern.ch/drupal/category/package-context/proof">PROOF</ulink>
cluster at user request, on any resource management system. It provides a plug-in based system, to use different job submission front-ends, such
as <ulink url="http://www.platform.com/">LSF</ulink> or <ulink url="http://web.infn.it/gLiteWMS/">gLite WMS</ulink>. PoD is fully automated and no special knowledge is required to start to use it.
Main components of PoD are pod-agent and pod-console. pod-agent provides the communication layer between a PROOF master on a local
machine and PROOF workers on remote resources, possibly behind a firewall. pod-console provides a user-friendly GUI, which is used
to setup, manage, and shutdown the dynamic PROOF cluster. Installation is simple and doesn't require administrator privileges, and
all the processes run in user space. PoD gives users, who don't have a centrally-administrated static PROOF cluster at their
institution, the possibility to enjoy the full power of interactive analysis with PROOF. It is also a very good alternative to
static PROOF clusters.

PoD is a specially designed solution to provide a PROOF cluster on the fly.
